2,"select objects from both where the objIDs -- are the same. The output of the function is a table with the Galaxy Object -- ID and distance in arcmin from the input. This query introduces the use of -- a JOIN to combine table contents. Also, we use the # syntax, -- which will sort the output. SELECT TOP # G.objID, GN.distance, G.deVMag_g - G.deVMag_i, G.deVMag_g FROM PhotoObj AS G JOIN dbo.fGetNearbyObjEq (#, #, #) AS GN -- this function outputs a table, so we have to do a join ON G.objID = GN.objID -- get objects from temporary neighbors table GN with desired ObjID WHERE (G.flags & dbo.fPhotoFlags (#) ) = # -- and the object is not saturated. f.PhotoFlags is a function that interprets the flag bits. ORDER BY distance -- sort these by distance"
